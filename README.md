# LoginPage
This is a simple WPF App coding using C# and Visual Studio Code that allow user to type in the username and password                       
If the user type in the username and password the program output: Thank you for providing the input, which will be verified.            
If user didn't type in both username and password then the program output: Please fill in all the slots
